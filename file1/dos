As a market research professional, your role in this externship is twofold. You will:

Build an understanding about one key issue ONE high-priority Key Issue highlighted above. To help you keep your research focussed, you will also be assigned a geographic region. This could be North America, Europe or Asia Pacific.
You will use your understanding about ONE high-priority Key Issue to look for notable policy influencers in that domain, find their contact details, highlight the niche topics that they are an expert in, and explain how their work will be valuable for the National Research Group team to consider.
 

In the upcoming modules, you will learn more about how the National Research Group defines these policy influencers and what is the region that is assigned to you, and how you can conduct your first round of market research.
