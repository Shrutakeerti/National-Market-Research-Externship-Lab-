At the end of this project, you are expected to share your learnings about the policy influencer landscape on the student platform. You can do this by clicking on ‘Project Task’ on the Dashboard under ‘Understanding the Market’.


On the platform, you will be asked to provide the following details:

Assigned Region
Key issue
Name of the organization
Influencer category
Name of the influencer
Details about the influencer
What did you find?
At this point, all these terms and tasks might sound alien to you, which is absolutely fine! The purpose of all the training material is to get you up-to-speed with all this and provide all the guidance you need so that can perform your tasks in the easiest way possible.
The training will help you:

Become familiar with the concepts and terms;
Provide additional instructions on how you can conduct the research;
Provide a sneak-peek on how to submit your work on the platform.
