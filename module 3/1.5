Welcome to the FAQs section of this project. Here, we've compiled common questions that may arise during your journey in identifying, shortlisting, and profiling policy influencers. If you have additional questions, feel free to reach out to your peers or your Program Manager over Slack.


1. What is the role of Project 2 in the overall program?
In this project, you have to identify and select influential figures in policy-making. This involves a detailed process of researching and profiling one policy influencer each day. This approach aims to prevent you from feeling overwhelmed and ensures that your analysis is comprehensive. This will ultimately help you reach your goal of conducting thorough profiling for a total of EIGHT policy influencers.

2. What are the key deliverables for this project?
You are expected to submit the details of 8 policy influencers on the student platform. These details include:

Name of the individual
Type of influencer (Expert, Informant or Official)
Name of the organization
Assigned geographic region (North America, Europe/EU, APAC)
Location
Contact Details
LinkedIn Profile, Website, etc.
Description
Key areas/issues of influence and initiatives
Current role/designation
Do they have any published work? [research papers, research articles, podcasts, interviews given, etc.]
Events attended in the recent past
Influence Score
Rationale of including them (how/why are they influencers?)
3. Do I have to pick all the eight policy influences from one organization?
You can choose to find all eight policy influencers from the SAME organization, OR they could be from different organizations. The only important thing is that they should work at the organizations mentioned on the ‘shortlisting sheet’ provided to you.

4. Where can I find the shortlisting spreadsheet?
The spreadsheet was introduced on the module “Project Deliverable Instructions”. For quick reference, you can find all the below as well.

5. How to navigate the sheet?
6. What does the different color coding in the sheet mean?
Not Highlighted indicates that no one has picked this organization yet.
Yellow indicates that you can still find policy influencers for that organization.
Green indicates that you need to pick another organization.
7. Can I reach out to the policy influencer directly?
Please keep in mind that you are NOT expected to connect with or contact any of these policy influencers. Your role is limited to only conducting research about these policy influencers.

8. What should I do if the chosen policy influencer does not meet all of the shortlisting criteria?
Not all the points mentioned in the criteria need to be met. However, make sure the policy influencer checks off at least 2 of the following 5 boxes:

 Have publicly available contact information (must)
 Have work experience of at least 5+ years;
 Are a part of the leadership team of the organization or a vertical/department of the organization;
 Have an online presence (beyond social media profiles, e.g. if you search for them on Google, they show up on the search results);
 Have a history of contributing to the discourse in notable ways. This could be through publishing research papers or articles, participating in or having their own podcast, having given interviews, or having a good enough (+1000) following on a professional networking website.
9. Do I need to conduct the research first and then submit the details on the platform?
Recording all your research on the student platform is crucial as it ensures your work is officially documented and recognized as complete. It is recommended that you keep adding the details as and when you finish conducting the research for each policy influencer so that your Program Manager is aware about your progress.

We hope these FAQs provide clarity and support. For further queries feel free to reach out to your peers and Program Manager.
