This module aims to:

Introduce you to the concept of ‘profiling’, types of profiling and how it is used by businesses;
Contextualize the task of ‘profiling’ to explain what it means in this externship;
Provide search strategies that will help you conduct the policy influencer profiling.
All of this together will solidify your understanding of how you will continue conducting the policy influencer search.

✅
Please be reminded that you are NOT expected to connect with or contact any of these policy influencers. Your role is limited to only conducting research about these policy influencers.

This module is divided into two sections.

The first half talks about profiling in its most generic sense.
The second half tries to emphasize the kind of profiling you need to conduct to help NRG meet its objective, and how you can find this information.
Let’s begin!


In this day and age, businesses are focussed on creating a very personalized experience for their customers and this is taking many shapes and forms. A music app that understands your listening habits and recommends similar artists or playlists you might like. A seamless shopping experience with products that seem curated just for you. Recommendations of content that only you may like. The list goes on. All this is largely made possible with consumer profiling.

WATCH: Through consumer profiling, businesses can get to the bottom of what their customers are looking for and how to offer them a product or service they'll really appreciate. This video introduces you to different types of consumer profiling and how these insights are used by businesses.


RECAP: 4 types of consumer profiling

Demographic
Geographic
Psychographic
Behavioral
You may already know how about how Little Moon leveraged the power of customer profiling to identify the right and ideal customer to keep growing their revenue. Starbucks has built a global coffee empire by creating personalized experiences for their customers through the extensive data collected through their highly successful rewards program. By analyzing user behavior and viewing patterns, Netflix is able to understand each customer's unique preferences and interests. This enables them to curate personalized content suggestions that keep customers engaged and coming back for more.

But what do these “profiles” even look like? Do they look the same for all businesses? The answer to the latter is a ‘no’. Profiles can look very different based on what data has been collected and the purpose for which the data has been collected. Even the methodology of data collection will be different. Do you think Little Moon, Starbucks and Netflix created a customer profile with in the same format? Obviously no!

BUT. There are very basic formats of what these profiles can look like. Below are a few examples.

This brings us to the most important part of this module. What kind of profiling do you need to conduct in this project? Policy influencer profiling comes close to ‘behavioral profiling’ or ‘abilities profiling’ (refer to the 4th image above), and this can be understood by revisiting the ‘why’ behind the policy influencer profiling.

Behavioral profiling

Analysis of an individual's actions, patterns, and tendencies to understand their personality, preferences, and potential future behaviors.

Abilities profiling

Profiling involves evaluating an individual's skills, strengths, and competencies to identify their capabilities and potential areas for development.

NRG works with several clients in the consumers good and technology sectors, among others. A particular focus of their research with these clients is to gather opinions on key topics from Policy Influencers.

Understanding how policy influencers think and feel helps companies “see around corners”, advancing knowledge of societal expectation before they become commonplace. It also provides insight that can shape policies and initiatives - ensuring compliance and mitigating reputational risks which further promotes a company’s license to operate.

Once the NRG team is able to find these policy influencers, they will..


Ultimately, the policy influencer profiling should help determine whether or not a particular policy influencer’s opinions will be valuable to inform new policies, adjust pre-existing ones, and update communication strategies for various businesses.
Keeping all this in mind, the following information needs to be included in the policy influencer profiling:

A brief overview of the educational background and work experience.
How does the policy influencer contribute to the organization through their current role?
Any notable events from their career, or any awards they might have won, any recent features that they may have received in any publication, etc.
What is their area of expertise?
Do they have any published work which could include research papers, research articles, podcasts, interviews given, etc.
Have they participated/will participate in any conferences, workshops, fireside chats, or any other event in the recent past or in the near future?
All of these behavioral traits and abilities will be the most valuable information in the profiling.

By the time you reach the profiling stage, you will have already identified 8 policy influencers. While shortlisting these policy influencers, make sure you’re considering all the points mentioned above.

How will you find this information? You probably have guessed by now, but here are two very simple ways in which you can find this information.

Targeted Google searches
LinkedIn activity
Targeted Google searches would require you to search for the person’s name, their current or past titles and their current or past organizations, and scroll through the search results.

[Name of the person] [title] [organization]

Here’s an example—>

An ideal policy influencer would have a significant online presence with at least 5—6 features on different websites. This goes on to show that they are actively involved in shaping the discourse surrounding an issue.



LinkedIn activity is where you will get the most curated information about the person. The number of followers and connections they have, the posts they share or the ones they are tagged in, the comments they leave, the events they are participating in, their professional journey over the course of time, everything can be found here. Most importantly, they will also lead you to other important people in their network that you may not have come across before!

You now have all the resources you need to conduct the policy influencer profiling. The journey from hereon is one that requires you to approach the tasks with a growth mindset. Keep reminding yourself that this is what learning looks like. And once you’ve crossed the bridge, you’ll know that you were capable all along
