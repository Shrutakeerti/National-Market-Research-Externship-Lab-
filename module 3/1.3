This module aims to:

Provide you with a a few simple search strategies that you can use to find policy influencers;
Provide you with a shortlisting criteria that you can use to select a policy influencer for further profiling;
Provide you with ways to find the contact details of a policy influencer.
All of this together will help you initiate your policy influencer profiling by first looking for a suitable policy influencer and find their contact details.

âœ…
Please be reminded that you are NOT expected to connect with or contact any of these policy influencers. Your role is limited to only conducting research about these policy influencers.

Before you begin your policy influencer search for a particular organization, it is important to have a fairly good understanding about the work that the organization does. Once you have built this understanding, you can move forward with the policy influencer search.
Search Strategies ðŸ‘€
Official website of the organization + LinkedIn + Google Search
LinkedIn + Google search
Company Directories + Google Search + LinkedIn search
1. Official website of the organization + LinkedIn + Google Search
WATCH: How to find people who work at the organization by leveraging the official website of the organization. Hereâ€™s an example for the organization Teach For India.

2. LinkedIn + Google search
(This strategy is especially useful when the website of the organization does not mention any names of the people who work there.) When using LinkedIn, you can follow these three simple steps.

Type the name of the organization in the search bar

Go to the â€˜People tabâ€™

Scroll through the page to see the people who work at the organization. Visit their profiles to see if they have any kind of LinkedIn activity. If they do, scroll through their posts.
Visit profiles of their co-workers too if they seem like a good fit. (more on the shortlisting criteria further ahead in the module).
3. Company Directories + Google Search + LinkedIn search
You can make use of company directories like:

Crunchbase
Zoominfo
Once you find the information about an organization on a company directory, you can look at the names of the people who work there and do a quick Google search. This will either lead you to their LinkedIn profile or other websites that feature them.

Hereâ€™s an example of what that could look like:


Shortlisting Criteria âœ…
Once you have come across different policy influencers, this shortlisting criteria should help you decide whether or not you want to conduct additional research about the policy influencer or not.

 Have publicly available contact information (must)
 Have work experience of at least 5+ years;
 Are a part of the leadership team of the organization or a vertical/department of the organization;
 Have an online presence (beyond social media profiles, e.g. if you search for them on Google, they show up on the search results);
 Have a history of contributing to the discourse in notable ways. This could be through publishing research papers or articles, participating in or having their own podcast, have given interviews, or have a good enough (+1000) following on a professional networking website.
Please note: Not all the points mentioned in the criteria need to be met. However make sure the policy influencer meets checks-off at least 2 of all the 5 boxes.

Contact Search Strategies
When you're searching and spending time on this process, use your best judgment as to how long to look for one piece of contact information. If you spend more than 5 minutes trying to obtain an individual's contact, it is probably better to move on to a different employee and try to obtain their contact instead. However, if it turns out that you are unable to obtain any employee-specific contacts from the particular company at all, obtaining a company's general information would be a good alternative. In the end, if you've exhausted all means to find a contact, it is best to move on and work on contacts for another organization or individual.

How to begin the contact search process
While engaging with the contact search process, your search will generally begin with one of three categories:

General Search Engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing!)
Social Media (FB, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn)
Local Business Directories and other Databases
Contact search with general search engines
A broad search criterion is sometimes most effectively reviewed by using major search engines and social media. These platforms can also validate whether the stakeholder is currently active (some organizations cease to operate, and some employees and staff change roles). Some examples of general search engines include Yahoo, Google, and Bing. These search engines are going to be relevant to you as they are one of the most well-developed search tools due to their access to large amounts of relevant data for your search.

In this scenario, the contact information of related stakeholders can be extracted from publicly accessible sources. This information can often be found on the stakeholder's website under relevant "About Us" or "Meet the Team", and "Contact Us" sections; likely placed on the top or bottom of the webpage.


Contact search with social media
At times, you may have to search for professional contact information, in which case LinkedIn is a great option. In this case, you need to be clear with the parameters of the search. You may be asked to search for contacts with specific criteria. For example: "find CEOs of a particular organization based in the United States."

After receiving the criteria, you may need to conduct an additional search to help yourself be more prepared for the task. Asking yourself important questions such as, "where do I find X & Y information to support me" would greatly help you. For instance, with reference to the Google search example above, you may need to search for Fortune 500's websites and apply the relevant filters to identify what Fortune 500 companies are in California and New York.

Next, you'll need to identify the people who are at the companies that fit the criteria you're searching for. On LinkedIn, you have to open the "People" section first before applying the relevant filters and identifying the right individuals to collect emails from.

After opening an individual's LinkedIn page, use the tools to obtain the individual's email. Occasionally the software may be bugged and not display the right email for the right individual (you can tell that a bug occurred since the extension may show a different profile). Simply refresh the tool you are using or the page, and you should be able to obtain the right email for the person.

Example criteria:
Search for Extern Employee Email

Step 1: utilize a general search engine to help you narrow down the criteria quickly

Step 2: Opening the link will lead you to Extern's LinkedIn page as shown below. To find the contacts of their employees. Open the "People" tabs highlighted below

Step 3: Identifying the right people in the company using LinkedIn. You can use filters to identify the right kind of employee you are looking for.

Example: seeking Extern employees with filter set to "recruiting"

Step 4: Click an employee's profile that matches the criteria

Step 5: use tools from your browser extensions to obtain an individual's email
The LeadLeaper and SalesQL email finder tools

How to get emails off LinkedIn using tools

Installing several extensions are often required to do the task efficiently. The tools could greatly help in your efforts to find a stakeholder's contact information.

Using Local Search Directories and Other Databases
Company/organization website or directory listing: Most companies take a lot of time and effort to build websites that give people the required information about the organization. In the case of smaller or more local companies, they might list their business on Google My Business, Google Maps, Yelp, YellowPages, or other online directories.
Apollo.io: An email marketing software with a powerful database of contacts.
Hunter.io: A great search tool for key email addresses. This tool provides free email searches for up to 50 email addresses. It is best used in combination with some LinkedIn research.
Clearbit Chrome Extension is a Gmail extension that helps retrieve official company emails and also helps to verify them.
In the upcoming modules, you will learn more about how you can conduct the next part of the policy influencer profiling.
