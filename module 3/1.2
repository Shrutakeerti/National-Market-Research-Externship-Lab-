This module aims to:

Give you a preview of what PART 1 of your search for and profiling of 8 policy influencers will look like.
This will help you begin understanding your next steps.

 

 
 

Your search for the 8 policy influencers BEGINS from this sheet. This Excel sheet given below:

*Please bookmark this sheet for later reference.

 

At the end of Project 1, you were assigned a geographic region. Each geographic region is a tab in this Excel sheet.


 

What data does this sheet contain?
 

Why, when and how do you have to use this sheet?
As you know, you have to submit the profiles of 8 policy influencers on the student platform at the end of this project.

These 8 policy influencers MUST work for/at one of the organizations mentioned in the sheet.

To ensure that there is no duplication of work and effort, the entire cohort will be working on this sheet together. But how?

*Please make sure to remove all the filters from the sheet once you are done choosing the organization of your interest.
*You will not edit any other column except for columns F to M.
 

You need to repeat these steps until you have reached the limit of 8 policy influencers. The details of the influencer should be input in this format:

Policy Influencer 1 (Name, Title)
Katherine Cullen, VP, Industry and Consumer Insights
You are required to add only ONE title.

 

âœ…

You can choose to find all the 8 policy influencers from the SAME organization, or the 8 could be from different organizations.

 

What does the YELLOW and GREEN color coding mean?
 

Important things to bear in mind:
Since the entire cohort will be working on this Google sheet, it is important to use this color coding as a way to communicate with each other. Yellow would indicate that you can still find policy influencers for that organization. Green would indicate that you need to pick another organization.
Please be mindful of the fact that you are not editing pre-filled columns and cells. Your Program Manager will be able to view the history of edits of this sheet and any plagiarism or unethical practices will be noticed and an action will be taken accordingly.
While conducting your research, you may notice that for some organizations it is very easy to find the details about the organization and the people who work there, while for others this data might not be readily available. Make sure you take this into consideration.
This is not the final deliverable of this project. You are still expected to submit the details of all the 8 policy influencers on the Project Tasks section.
 

In case you have any questions about how to use the sheet, please post your questions on the channel #profiling.

 

Now, of course the process of filling-up this sheet is not going to be so linear.
 

In the upcoming modules, you will explore how you will find the policy influencers once you have chosen a key issue, influencer category and organization, and how you need to document the details about all the influencers.
