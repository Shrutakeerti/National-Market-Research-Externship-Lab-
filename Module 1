Little Moons is a UK-based mochi ice-cream brand that shot to fame in 2021 through a viral Tik Tok trend. What was the trend though? This, this was the trendâ€”


Little Moons took to TikTok, setting up a business account to organically enhance their brand recognition. In February 2020, they executed a One Day Max In-Feed Ad campaign. This type of advertisement appears directly on TikTok's For You Page, blending seamlessly with user content as they scroll, giving it a natural look and feel as opposed to seeming like a sponsored ad.

The advertisement was designed to be fun, captivating, and educational.
It highlighted that Little Moons could be purchased at Tesco supermarkets and suggested letting the dessert sit for 5 minutes before indulging in its creamy gelato wrapped in soft mochi dough.
This straightforward advertisement propelled Little Moons to stardom in the dessert category, with Tesco sales soaring by 1,300%.
The advertisement itself amassed 6.7 million views, and the Little Moons TikTok profile grew to 137,000 followers. Furthermore, it sparked a widespread TikTok craze, inspiring users to search for Little Moons in their local stores and share reviews of every flavor they discovered. The hashtags #LittleMoons and #Littlemoonsmochi have since gathered over 101 million and 80 million views, respectively.

But!
