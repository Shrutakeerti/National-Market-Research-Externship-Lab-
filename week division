Externships help you tackle complex and ambiguous business scenarios in an organized and guided manner. Hence the program has been scaffolded into 3 task-based projects.

 

This is what you will be doing over the next 4 weeks-

Project 1 [Understanding the Market]	Week 1	In this project, you will establish a foundational understanding of the policy influence landscape relevant to the host company's interests, by conducting independent online research and learning from your peers.
Project 2 [Prospect Policy Influencer Profiling]	Weeks 2-3	In this project, you will pinpoint and profile the most influential and different types of policy influencers that have a direct and significant impact on the companyâ€™s interest areas. You will focus on the geographic region pre-assigned to you, and the instructions in the training material will guide you how to go about identifying and shortlisting the policy influencers.
Project 3 [Synthesis and Strategic Recommendations]	Week 4	In this project, you will synthesize research findings and showcase the chosen influencers from the assigned region and chosen interest area.
